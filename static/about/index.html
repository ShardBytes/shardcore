      our game A Light in The Void.

            Starting in 2014, when two of us met in a high school English course. You
            can say it is quite interesting, when two very shy introverts meet and
            start looking at each other, can't you :). But curiosity is stronger than
            insecurity and we began to talk, eventually becoming good friends.
            Sometime in 2017, we made our first ever commercial application - Library
            Book Scanner. It wasn't very successful though and never took off. By the
            beginning of 2018, we welcomed 3 more guys to help us with graphics and
            music. In April 2018 we launched our first ever game - A Light in The Void
             - and we won the 3rd place in a nationwide HS & College programming
             competition. It didn't take too long, until we released our second
             commercial application in February 2019 - Keksobox - that actually became
             successful and is now used among a few buffets in Slovakia.
